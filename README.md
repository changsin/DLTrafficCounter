# Deep Learning for Traffic Counting
Here is the code repository and the dataset referred in the article [Deep Learning for Traffic Counting](https://changsin.medium.com/deep-learning-for-traffic-counting-1821079d5871).

- The sample dataset is from [AI Hub 30743](https://aihub.or.kr/aidata/30743).
- models/yolov5s_highway.pt is the custom trained model with the sample dataset after 400 hundred epochs.
- - The annotation xml file had to be converted to YOLO V5 format. The code can be found in the [Colab notebook](https://github.com/changsin/DLTrafficCounter/blob/main/notebooks/traffic_counter_yolov5.ipynb).
